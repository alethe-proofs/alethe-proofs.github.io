# Alethe -- Flexible, SMT-LIB Native Proofs

The Alethe project provides tools and formats to express proofs generated by automated reasoning tools, especially SMT solvers.  Alethe proofs are based on the SMT-LIB language.  Most contemporary SMT solvers use SMT-LIB as their input language.  Therefore, Alethe proofs integrate well with the existing ecosystem.

The **Alethe Calculus** is a thoroughly documented proof calculus for core SMT-LIB logics.  Proofs in the Alethe calculus can be produced by the SMT solvers cvc5 and veriT.   These proofs can be checked by the high-performance proof checker Carcara, and multiple systems, such as Isabelle/HOL, and SMTCoq, can read Alethe proofs.

The **AletheLF** framework is an emerging logical framework to express SMT proofs.  It takes inspiration from the Alethe Calculus and the LFSC framework.  The cvc5 solver can produce AletheLF proofs.  Since the cvc5 calculus was formalized in AletheLF, the alfc proof checker can be used to check cvc5 AletheLF proofs.
